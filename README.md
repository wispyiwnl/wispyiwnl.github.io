This page will contain everything from definitions of words I once didnâ€™t know and might forget, to notes and resources I use daily for auditing or developing smart contracts.

I will soon add articles I've written, covering tutorials, research, and storytelling pieces. The main focus will be on security in smart contracts, Web3, and development.
